</p>

e-KasiCare generates structured health data that can be leveraged by governments and NGOs for:

- **Outbreak Prevention & Response**  
  Real-time tracking of symptoms and clinic visits can signal early outbreaks, enabling faster mobilization of healthcare resources.

- **Predictive Payment Systems**  
  For patients receiving grants for TB, HIV, or chronic conditions, governments can use the data to predict and validate payment schedules.

- **National Health Record Integration**  
  As patients move from one area to another, their medical records follow them—creating continuity of care across clinics and provinces.

- **Resource Planning & Budgeting**  
  Use trends in diagnoses and patient loads to forecast future needs in medication, staffing, and mobile clinics.

- **NGO/Private Sector Collaboration**  
  Anonymized data enables partnerships and interventions tailored to local health needs and behaviors.
